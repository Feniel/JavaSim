The solution for task 4 from homework 2

The solution is in JavaSim/src/test/java/org/javasim/examples/basicWithMonitor

Task: 4.The Basic example of JavaSim is implemented so that all needed data collection is written inside the processes etc. For more complex models this may become tedious. Create a monitoring process that collects data and reports it as needed. That is, create a SimulationProcess Monitor that runs in eternal loop of holding itself for given sampling interval and then collecting a sample of the data it needs from monitored processes (using their methods).  See examples for lecture 3. Use this class to sample average queue lengths and average utilization for machine of your choice. (You can do this on top of any of JavaSim models treated here - even the Basic model if you can not manage with its above modifications).
