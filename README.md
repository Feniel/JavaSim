Consider the situation of the previous exercises. That is, P preparation rooms, one operating theatre and R recovery rooms with no intermediate buffer capacity between them. Assume still only one patient stream with exponentially distributed arrival and service times (means: interarrival time 25, preparation time 40, operation time 20, recovery time 40). (It is easy to infer that ideally we should have 80% utilization of operation room and on average less than two patients in preparation and recovery). For simplicity, we assume continuous operation. We shall monitor the building up of a queue before preparation, idle capacity of the preparation and the rate of blocking of operations.

Run 20 independent samples of 1000 time units. (It may be wise to foresee the needs of all the problems at once to not have to rerun samples).

1.  Observe the length of a queue before preparation room, the length of idle queue for preparation rooms and the probability of operation being in waiting state (blocked). You can do this by sampling the variables with regular rate. Compute the point estimates (means), and interval estimates (confidence intervals for means) for 95% confidence level. Do this for three different configurations (3 preparation rooms, 4 recoveries: 3p 5r, 4p 5r).
